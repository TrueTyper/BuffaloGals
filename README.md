# Buffalo Gals™
 
Buffalo Gals is one of the very first “Variable Fonts”, originally made in 1992 for an Apple TrueType GX developer CD. It was intended to push the boundaries on the number of stylistic axes in a font, with 6 axes in total, none of them being weight or width. Based upon wood type of the late 1800’s, Buffalo Gals enables control over features with names like Cookies, Fringe, Hooves, Concavity and Bracketing. It offers 144 distinct combinations of these attributes, and seemingly infinite intermediate interpolations as well.
 
My hope is to update this to support the new OpenType version 1.8 specification. Please read the [EULA], which limits usage for development, prototyping and testing purposes – and not for re-distribution or commercial use.

To test the functionality in this font, try [FontView] or [Axis-Praxis.org].
